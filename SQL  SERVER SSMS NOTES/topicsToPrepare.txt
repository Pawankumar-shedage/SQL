Before diving into LeetCode SQL problems, it's important to build a solid foundation in SQL. Here are the key topics you should prepare:

1. **Basic Queries**:
   - SELECT statements
   - Filtering data using WHERE
   - Sorting results using ORDER BY

2. **Joins**:
   - INNER JOIN
   - LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
   - RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
   - FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
   - CROSS JOIN
   - Self JOIN

3. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
   - GROUP BY
   - HAVING

4. **Subqueries**:
   - Subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
   - Correlated subqueries

5. **Set Operations**:  ✔
   - UNION, UNION ALL
   - INTERSECT
   - EXCEPT (or MINUS)

6. **String Functions**:
   - CONCAT, LENGTH, SUBSTRING, REPLACE
   - UPPER, LOWER, TRIM

7. **Date Functions**:  ✔
   - GETDATE, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATEPART
   - FORMAT, CONVERT

8. **Conditional Statements**:
   - CASE statements
   - IF statements (or equivalent logic in SQL Server)

9. **Data Types**:
   - Understanding different data types in SQL Server
   - Type conversion functions (CAST, CONVERT)

10. **Indexes and Performance Tuning**:
    - Understanding indexes and their impact on query performance
    - Basic performance tuning techniques

11. **Constraints and Keys**:
    - Primary Key, Foreign Key
    - Unique, NOT NULL, CHECK constraints

12. **Transactions**:
    - BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
    - Understanding ACID properties

13. **Views and Stored Procedures**:
    - Creating and using views
    - Writing stored procedures and functions

14. **Error Handling**:
    - TRY...CATCH blocks

By covering these topics, you'll be well-prepared to tackle SQL problems on LeetCode and other coding platforms.
